Create a "Water Behavior Visualizer" Interactive Element

Objective: Design a visually engaging and interactive component for a blog post that powerfully demonstrates the difference in how water reacts to an unprotected car paint surface versus a professionally ceramic-coated surface.

How It Should Look & Work:

Main Display Area: Imagine a sleek, premium display area on the webpage, perhaps shaped like a section of a car's hood or a clean, flat panel. It should convey a sense of high-quality automotive finish.
Side-by-Side Comparison: This display area should be clearly divided into two distinct sections, arranged side-by-side.
Left Section: Clearly labeled "Unprotected Paint" or "Before Coating." It represents a standard car finish.
Right Section: Clearly labeled "Ceramic Coated" or "After Coating." It represents a surface treated with ceramic coating.
User Interaction: Within each section, there should be a very clear, simple trigger that the user can activate (e.g., a button, or clicking directly on the panel itself). This trigger should initiate a visual "water application" simulation for that specific section.
Visual Behavior - Unprotected Side:
When the trigger for this side is activated, water should appear on the surface.
The water should visibly sheet across the panel. This means it should spread out broadly and relatively flat, appearing to cling to the surface. It might linger for a moment before slowly dissipating.
Visual Behavior - Coated Side:
When the trigger for this side is activated, water should appear on the surface.
The water should immediately form into distinct, tight, highly rounded beads (like perfect little spheres).
These beads should then visibly and quickly roll off the surface, leaving minimal to no residue behind. The movement should be fluid and effortless.
Visual Aesthetic: The overall design should be clean, modern, and visually appealing. The water effects should be smooth and convincing, enhancing the sense of clarity and protection on the coated side.
Responsiveness: The entire interactive element should adjust gracefully and function perfectly on various screen sizes, from large desktop monitors down to mobile phones.
The goal is for the user to clearly see, at a glance, the superior water repellency and easy-clean properties that ceramic coating provides.
