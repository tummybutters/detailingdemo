Where Passion Meet Precision:
Hi, I’m Ian – Welcome to Hardy's Wash N' Wax!
I'm a 23-year-old UC Davis graduate, substitute teacher, and car detailing enthusiast. Teaching has taught me patience, precision, and the value of a job done right – the same qualities I bring to every car I detail. While I’ve enjoyed my time in the classroom, my ultimate goal is to turn this detailing business into a full-time career.
I take pride in seeing the transformation – a car looking even better than the day it rolled off the lot. Whether it’s restoring a vehicle’s original shine or giving it that extra polish, my focus is always on the details that matter.
My mission is simple: combine my passion for cars with my commitment to delivering results you’ll love. Let’s make your car something to smile about.
–
Driving’s better when the only thing on your mind is an open road—not a month’s worth of mess under your feet.
–
People underestimate the calm of a deep breath  in a car that feels brand new.
