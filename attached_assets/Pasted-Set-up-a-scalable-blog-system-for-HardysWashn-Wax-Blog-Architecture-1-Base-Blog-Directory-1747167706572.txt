Set up a scalable blog system for HardysWashn'Wax.

### Blog Architecture:

1. **Base Blog Directory**
   - Route all blog posts under `/blog`
   - Each blog post will be at `/blog/[slug]` (e.g. /blog/interior-detailing-for-pet-hair)

2. **Blog Index Page**
   - Create `/blog` as a central index page
   - It should list all blog posts dynamically or from a JSON/posts array
   - For each post, show:
     - Title
     - 1–2 sentence excerpt/summary
     - Publish date
     - Link to full post (`/blog/[slug]`)

3. **Single Blog Post Template**
   - Reusable blog template file (e.g. `BlogPost.js`)
   - Each post should:
     - Use proper semantic HTML (`<h1>`, `<h2>`, etc.)
     - Include dynamic metadata (title, meta description, OG tags)
     - Support inserting custom components (like from uiverse.io)
     - Allow FAQ schema and Article schema via embedded JSON-LD

4. **Content Input Method**
   - Create a way to define each blog post in JSON, Markdown, or JS object format like:
     ```js
     {
       slug: "ceramic-coating-tesla-san-diego",
       title: "Ceramic Coating for Teslas in San Diego",
       metaDescription: "...",
       date: "2025-05-15",
       content: [ ...structured content or markdown blocks... ],
       uiComponent: "ToggleTips",
       faqSchema: [ ... ],
       serviceLink: "/services/ceramic-coating"
     }
     ```

5. **Design Rules**
   - Keep styling consistent with the rest of the site
   - Mobile responsive
   - Use the same font system and CTA button design
   - Include footer with internal links to main site sections and blog

6. **SEO Features**
   - Auto-generate meta `<title>` and `<meta description>` from blog object
   - Insert structured data (`Article`, `FAQPage`) from blog object
   - Each post must be crawlable and included in the sitemap
   - Sitemap should auto-update with new posts if possible

7. **Ready for Future Posts**
   - Leave placeholder example content for one blog post (can be generic)
   - Make it easy for me to duplicate and replace with real post info

This is just the setup. Don’t create real content yet — I’ll plug that in manually when ready.
