Search Box API Endpoints
The Search Box API includes following endpoints to support various location search use cases:

/suggest and /retrieve endpoints are used together to build an Interactive Search with Autocomplete for your app.
/forward endpoint is used to create a Search Request for Text Search
/category endpoint is used to create a Category Search
/reverse endpoint is used to create a Reverse lookup
Interactive Search (Autocomplete)
With the Search Box API, developers can create an autocomplete search experience that makes it easier for users to find not only addresses, but also points of interest (POIs), categories of POIs, street names, neighborhoods, localities, place names, districts, postcodes, regions, and countries.

PLAYGROUND
Search Box API User Demo
Try Search Box API powered interactive search on a map.

The /suggest endpoint is used in combination with the /retrieve endpoint to create an interactive search experience for end users. Within your application, send user search queries to the /suggest endpoint to get suggested results for the given search query.

When a user selects a result on the application UI, you should trigger a /retrieve request to get detailed information about the selection.

Get suggested results
get
https://api.mapbox.com/search/searchbox/v1/suggest?q={search_text}
This endpoint provides a list of suggested search results for the user query. This endpoint, along with the /retrieve endpoint, can be used to add autocomplete search functionality to your applications.

Required parameters	Type	Description
q	string	The user's query string. The query is limited to 256 characters.
access_token	string	A Mapbox access token with default permissions.
session_token	string	A customer-provided session token value, which groups a series of requests together for billing purposes. UUIDv4 is recommended. For more information on how session_token is used to group Search API calls into one session, see the Session-based pricing section of this documentation.
You can further refine the results of a query to this endpoint with the following optional parameters:

Optional parameters	Type	Description
language	string	The ISO language code to be returned. If not provided, the default is English.
limit	integer	The number of results to return, up to 10.
proximity	string	Bias the response to favor results that are closer to a specific location. Provide either ip to get results closest to the user's IP location or provide two comma-separated coordinates in longitude,latitude order. If not provided, the default is IP proximity. When both proximity and origin are provided, origin is interpreted as the target of a route, while proximity indicates the current user location.
bbox	string	Limit results to only those contained within the supplied bounding box. Bounding boxes should be supplied as four numbers separated by commas, in minimum longitude,minimum latitude,maximum longitude,maximum latitude order. The bounding box cannot cross the 180th meridian.

Category Search
Category Search makes it possible to browse entire categories of results, like coffee shops, hotels, and bookstores around a specific location or along a route.

The /category endpoint provides a list of POIs for a given location. In a search use case, this endpoint is used to create hot-buttons to execute search for a specific category, for example a coffee button that surfaces all nearby coffee shops.

Retrieve POIs by category
get
https://api.mapbox.com/search/searchbox/v1/category/{canonical_category_id}
Use the Category Search endpoint if you want to query points of interest (POIs) results filtered by a category at a specific location or along a route. The endpoint will only return POIs with the specified category.

Examples how you can use the /category endpoint:

Find food around you (food_and_drink)
Find an Indian restaurant (indian_restaurant)
Find a gas station along a route (gas_station)
Required parameters	Type	Description
access_token	string	A Mapbox access token with default permissions.
You can further refine the results of a query to this endpoint with the following optional parameters:

Optional parameters	Type	Description
language	string	The ISO language code to be returned. If not provided, the default is English.
limit	integer	The number of results to return, up to 25.
proximity	string	Bias the response to favor results that are closer to a specific location. Provide either ip to get results closest to the user's IP location or provide two comma-separated coordinates in longitude,latitude order. If not provided, the default is IP proximity. When both proximity and origin are provided, origin is interpreted as the target of a route, while proximity indicates the current user location.
bbox	string	Limit results to only those contained within the supplied bounding box. Bounding boxes should be supplied as four numbers separated by commas, in minimum longitude,minimum latitude,maximum longitude,maximum latitude order. The bounding box cannot cross the 180th meridian.
country	string	A comma-separated list of ISO 3166 alpha 2 country codes.
types	string	Limit results to one or more types of features, provided as a comma-separated list. Pass one or more of the type names as a comma separated list. If no types are specified, all possible types may be returned. Available types are: country, region, postcode, district, place, city, locality, neighborhood, street, address, poi, and category. See the Administrative unit types section for details about these types.
poi_category_exclusions	string	A comma-separated list of canonical category names that limits POI results to those that are not part of the given categories.
sar_type	string	Enable search-along-route (SAR) requests that shows the search results around the path provided with route parameter. The only allowed value for this parameter is isochrone.
route	string	When SAR is enabled, a polyline encoded linestring describing the route to be used for searching. Both polyline5 and polyline6 precision are accepted, but must be specified using the route_geometry parameter. Note that for /forward queries searching along a route, only brand and category searches are supported.
route_geometry	string	When SAR is enabled, passed in conjunction with a route polyline describing its precision. Options are polyline or polyline6. If this parameter is not provided with a route, the default is polyline. Correct results depend on including the right route_geometry for the route provided.
time_deviation	number	When SAR is enabled, maximum detour allowed in estimated minutes from the route.

Upgrade to Search Box API from Mapbox Geocoding API
For existing Mapbox Geocoding API customers, upgrading to the Search Box API provides access to up-to-date POI (Points of Interest) data, enhancing capabilities beyond the standard address geocoding provided by the Geocoding API.

You may consider the following steps when planning your upgrade:

Update the Geocoding API endpoint in your application
To migrate to the Search Box API, update your application's API endpoints. See the following comparison how endpoints of both products offer.

equivalent of Forward Geocoding endpoints in Search Box API are /suggest and /retrieve and /forward
equivalent of Reverse Geocoding endpoints in Search Box API is /reverse
Search Box API can be implemented by using search sessions or search requests.

Using search sessions
If your app includes an interactive search feature for users, use the /suggest and /retrieve endpoints of the Search Box API. While the user is typing the query, each keystroke will trigger the /suggest endpoint, and selecting a search result will trigger the /retrieve endpoint. This use case is different from how Geocoding API works; where each keystroke triggers a /forward Geocoding API request.

Using /suggest and /retrieve endpoints together will create a billing session, and your requests will be charged based on session-based pricing.

Using search requests
You can also send one-off search request to the /forward endpoint of the Search Box API. This is like using Geocoding API's /forward endpoint. This endpoint is billed per request.

Update your app to with the new response schema
Both Geocoding API and Search Box API returns GeoJSON objects as the search response, but there are slight differences in the naming and the scope of the attributes. when upgrading, you need to update your application's data schema. If you are using Mapbox Search SDK, consider utilizing the provided classes for the Search Box API.

Control your response
The Search Box API empowers developers to tailor search results according to specific needs. This includes the ability to include or exclude certain categories of Points of Interest (POIs) in the responses. By configuring parameters, developers can determine the types of features (such as localities, addresses, and places of interest) that appear in the search results.

Understand how billing works for both APIs
The Geocoding API operates on a per-request billing model, where each call to the API incurs a separate charge. In contrast, the Search Box API offers flexible billing options, supporting both per-session and per-request pricing, depending on the endpoints utilized.

When transitioning from the per-request model of the Geocoding API to the session-based model of the Search Box API, you can calculate the estimated number of Search Box API sessions by dividing your total number of Geocoding API requests by the average number of interactions needed to complete a search. For instance, if users of a mobile application typically engage with 7 keystrokes to complete their search, what before resulted in 8 individual requests in the Geocoding API would now correspond to a single session in the Search Box API.

For more details, review Mapbox Search Pricing.

Administrative unit types
Various types of administrative units are available via the Search Box API. Any type might appear as a top-level response, as context in a top-level response, or as a filtering option using the optional types parameter. See the following table for available administrative unit types.

Administrative unit type	Description
country	Generally recognized countries or, in some cases like Hong Kong, an area of quasi-national administrative status that has a designated country code under ISO 3166-1.
region	Top-level sub-national administrative features, such as states in the United States or provinces in Canada or China.
postcode	Postal codes used in country-specific national addressing systems.
district	Features that are smaller than top-level administrative features but typically larger than cities, in countries that use such an additional layer in postal addressing (for example, prefectures in China).
place	Typically these are cities, villages, municipalities, etc. They’re usually features used in postal addressing, and are suitable for display in ambient end-user applications where current-location context is needed (for example, in weather displays).
locality	Official sub-city features present in countries where such an additional administrative layer is used in postal addressing, or where such features are commonly referred to in local parlance. Examples include city districts in Brazil and Chile and arrondissements in France.
neighborhood	Colloquial sub-city features often referred to in local parlance. Unlike locality features, these typically lack official status and may lack universally agreed-upon boundaries. Not available for reverse lookup requests.
street	The street, with no house number.
address	Individual residential or business addresses as a street with house number.
Language and Geography Support
Supported languages
The Search Box API supports text queries in following languages; Czech, Croatian, Danish, Dutch, English, Estonian, Finnish, French, German, Greek, Hungarian, Italian, Japanese, Lithuanian, Latvian, Polish, Portuguese, Romanian, Russian, Slovak, Slovenian, Spanish, Swedish, Turkish, Ukrainian.

You can set a language by providing supported IETF language tags to the language API parameter. You can also provide a comma separated list of language codes. In this case, the first supported language encountered in the list will be used to process the request.

Supported geographies
The Search Box API supports United States, Canada and Europe.

Search Box API errors
Response body message	HTTP error code	Description
Not authorized	401	Check the access token used in the query.
Bad request	400	Check the request for syntax errors in the endpoint, path parameters, and query parameters.
Forbidden	403	There may be an issue with your account. Check your Account page for more details.

In some cases, using an access tokens with URL restrictions can also result in a 403 error. For more information, see our Token management guide.
Search Box API restrictions and limits
The Mapbox Terms of Service state that all data returned by the Search Box API endpoints is only available for temporary use. If your use case requires storing position data, contact Mapbox sales.
The default rate limit for the Mapbox Search Box API is 10 requests per second. If you require a higher rate limit, contact Mapbox Sales.
Calls to the Search Box API's /suggest and /retrieve endpoints must include a session_token parameter. Each API call in a search session counts individually against the rate limit. For example, 10 sequential calls to /suggest with the same session_token and one call to /retrieve are 11 requests per the rate limit, but are billed as belonging to a single session. See more about how the Search Box API is billed in the Session Billing section of this documentation.
Search Box API pricing
Pricing for the Mapbox Search Box API is based on which API endpoints are used. If you are using the /suggest or /retrieve endpoints, usage will be billed per search session. If you are using the /category or /reverse endpoints, usage will be billed per request.

For more details, review Mapbox Search Pricing.

Session Billing
A Search Session is a series of Search API calls bundled together for billing purposes. The Search Box API's /suggest and /retrieve endpoints must include a session_token parameter. The session_token parameter is used to group a series of requests together into one session for billing purposes.

A session ends after the following actions:

Make a call to /suggest followed by a call to /retrieve with a common session_token.
Make 50 successive calls to /suggest with a common session_token but are not followed by a call to /retrieve.
Make a call to /suggest and 60 minutes pass without being followed by a call to /retrieve.
