You are a senior full‑stack developer + technical SEO expert. Audit and refactor the entire HardysWashn'Wax site so that it is fully optimized for LOCAL + TECHNICAL SEO targeting Davis, California (ZIP 95616) and every township within a 30‑minute drive (Woodland, Dixon, Winters, West Sacramento, Esparto, Sacramento International Airport).

**Objectives**
1. Achieve “Good” scores for all THREE Core Web Vitals after March 12 2024 (LCP ≤2.5 s, CLS ≤0.1, INP ≤200 ms).
2. Maximise visibility in Google’s Search Generative Experience (SGE) and voice search results.
3. Rank top‑3 organically for queries such as:
   - “car wash Davis CA”
   - “mobile detailing Davis”
   - “auto detailing Woodland”
   - “ceramic coating Dixon”
   - “hand wash near UC Davis”

**Mandatory Technical Tasks**
- Replace any legacy FID code comments with INP optimisation: minimise JavaScript main‑thread blocking, break up long tasks, use `scheduler.yield()` where helpful, and deliver critical CSS inline.
- Serve images as WebP/AVIF, include explicit width/height, `loading="lazy"`, and `fetchpriority="high"` for the hero image.
- Use HTTP/3 and enable `Early Hints` + `rel="preload"` for fonts and primary CSS.
- Generate an XML sitemap + robots.txt and link from `robots.txt`.
- Add `<link rel="canonical">` on every page; prevent duplicate URL parameters with canonicalisation rules.
- Implement PWA basics (service worker with stale‑while‑revalidate) so the site passes “installable” in Lighthouse.
- Follow accessibility best‑practices (WCAG 2.2 AA): semantic HTML5, ARIA landmarks, contrast ≥4.5:1.

**Local SEO & Content Tasks**
- Replace all existing Irvine/SoCal mentions with Davis‑area phrasing. Include UC Davis references on home + service pages for contextual relevance.
- Create a short, unique service‑area paragraph on every major page:  
  “Proudly serving Davis, Woodland, Dixon, Winters & West Sacramento – if you’re within 30 minutes we’ll come to you.”
- Embed a Google Map centered on Davis (lat 38.5449, lon ‑121.7405) with a ‘Service Area’ polygon.
- Build individual location landing pages (`/woodland-car-detailing`, etc.) and cross‑link them in the footer.
